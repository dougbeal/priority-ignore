        %p
          According to the Harvard School of Business, there are <a
          href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2009/05/two-lists-you-should-look-at-e.html">two
          lists</a> you should look at every morning, and perhaps
          every chance you get: the list of things that are important
          to you, and the list of things that you should ignore.  

        %p 
          Prioritize / Ignore is an extension of that idea: a
          reminder, each and every time you open your browser, of what
          is important, and what is not.  

        %p 
          To use: Just click on either header.  A new entry will open
          up in that list for you to fill out.  Empty entries will be
          deleted automatically.  <b>All data is stored in your 
          browser's local store; there are no servers, and your data
          is never transmitted anywhere.</b>

        %p
          You can click on the gear icon in the lower
          left-hand corner any time you like to review this page.
