# Priorityignore

A simple program to show/hide priorities.

## Documentation A couple of weeks ago, I read an article in the
Harvard Business Review entitled Two Lists You Should Look At Every
Morning[1]. The first is the usual priority list: everything you care
about, that you want to spend your attention span on.  The other, even
more important list, is everything you will ignore: everything that
distracts you, saps your time, that takes you away from your
achievements.  To make a list of everything you do that, ultimately,
doesn't make you happy.

It was a solid idea, and I thought it would make a good variation on
RightNow!, my last "priority manager" that keeps list of everything
you care about.  Like RightNow, Priority/Ignore uses your browser's
localstore to store its data: nothing is stored here, or anywhere
else, and every browser will have its own local store.  If you use
more than one browser, this may present a problem, but most people
have one browser per device, and these lists shouldn't be that long.

This is mostly a tech demo for various JS tools.
